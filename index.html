	<p>I am a software/machine learning engineer currently working at <a href="https://www.robustintelligence.com/" target="_blank">Robust Intelligence</a> in Cambridge, MA. Broadly, my research interests are in machine learning, scientific computing, and extremal graph theory.</p>
	<p>I recently graduated from Harvard College, where I received an AB in Computer Science and Mathematics, and an SM in Applied Mathematics.</p>
	<p>My other "research interests" involve <a href="https://letterboxd.com/eniagater/" target="_blank">watching movies</a>, looking at watches, <a href="http://www.typeracerdata.com/profile?username=retagaine" target="_blank">typing</a>, and listening to music.</p>
